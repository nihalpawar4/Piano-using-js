# PIANO USING JAVASCRIPT:

This is a simple web application that allows you to play the piano using your computer keyboard or mouse. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation:

To use the application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/piano-js.git
cd piano-js
open index.html

## Usage:

Once you have opened the index.html file in your web browser, you can use your computer keyboard or mouse to play the piano.
The white keys can be played by pressing the corresponding letter key on your keyboard (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L),
while the black keys can be played by pressing the shift key along with the corresponding letter key (Shift + A, Shift + S, etc.).

You can also click on the keys with your mouse to play them.

## Development:

If you would like to modify the code and develop the application further, you can use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code to edit the files. 
Its logic is written in the script.js file, and the HTML and CSS are written in the index.html and style.css files.
